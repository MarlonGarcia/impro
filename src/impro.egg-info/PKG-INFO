# Image Processing Functions (impro)

This library is dedicated to image processing functions, comprising Machine Learning algorithms in the Intelligence module, and light-tissue interactions simulations in the Monte Carlo module.

## Module of Intelligence

With this module you can train and test Machine Learning algorithms, like Random Forest

Use the following code to import this module after install this package:
```
from impro import intelligence
```


## How to Install

You can install using `pip`:

```
pip install impro==0.0.3
```
